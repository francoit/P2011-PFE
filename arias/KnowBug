Adding the bug list from Tricia
+ Help in menu is not working
+ Company update - after clicking save changes no confirmation of save
  and the words 'credit limit' appear at top above company name.
Payroll - what is the annual exemption allowance on federal tax add?
Payroll->setup functions for payroll->standard GL accounts - 
  after filling out the form and clicking save, no success confirmation 
  and leaves you on a blank page with nowhere to go!  However, if you go 
  to  Payroll->setup functions for payroll->general factors (in the same 
  group of Payroll forms), and fill in info and click “Save Changes”, 
  then the form redraws with the comment “Update Successful” on the top, 
  and all the values you filled in redrawn.  Why does ‘standard GL accounts’ 
  not function in that same correct manner?
+ Under Inventory->Setup Functions for Inventory - Markups List is supposed
  to call invmarkuplist.php but doesn’t come up.
Go to Purchasing->New Purchase Order. Now, fill out the new PO – then 
  when you are at the point where you specify how many units to order 
  from vendor (“itempriceach”.$i in invpoadd.php), and then click ‘Add 
  line item to PO’, then the price/package SHOULD fill in automatically 
  (to reflect the correct price break), but it doesn’t.  These vendor 
  prices exist in another table, so they ARE accessible.

- min/max switched in item distribution report

- Upload Graphic and Catalogsheet Fix
Check Account Didn't really create a check and put in the Database,
  so The AP is not complete.
Item Status have some problem, Item Available will be "0" Then there
  isn't any Item order/Shipped for that particular item.
Bad path setup on the PDF/CVS Files Export, or All downloadable
  files. Making people using http://www.example.com/aria/ a sublevel dir
  cannot see the path.
Session crash with some php web application that didn't have Session
  Name setup.
Complete PO --> AP making a big mistake, aria should be adding 1 x
  Tax and 1 x shipping charge to GL account but, it add "N" number of
  time. N is denoted by the Numbers of Item on the Invoice.
Opening Balance/Closing Not possible yet on current situation.
