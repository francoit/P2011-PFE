Translator Info
---------------

If you like ARIA, then why not translate it into your native language?

1. Go to the include/lang/ subdirectory

2. Copy 1.php to an  unassigned_number.php

3. Update the comment at the top of the file. Put yourself as the language maintainer.
   Edit the 'applang' variable and put your language's name in it, in your language.
   Edit the 'STR_CHAR_SET' variable and put in the name of the encoding for your language.

4. Go through as much of the rest of the file as you wish, replacing the English strings
   with strings in your language.

5. Send your contribution to us. We need the unassigned_number.php entry in include/lang/.

6. Thank you for your contribution! You have just made ARIA accessible to
   thousands more users!

7. There exists a tool named 'langcheck' in the include/lang/ directory.  To run it, just type
   'php langcheck <language_number>'.  It will give you a report about which strings are missing
   from your language file and which need to be deleted.
