---------
Restructure menu in a more logical fashion. Example: Place delete customer on its own page rather then being combined
with the update function as there is too much room for error

--------
- Getting how multiple languages work from phppgadmin (without recode will be the best) using array so that translating will be easy and they can check from new translated variable.
- Inventory is still blocking the way.

--------
*+ Inventory function is not work fully.
- Before Translate the files a new way of translate should be implemented.
* All defines(configuration files) should have a *-dist files and in CVS should be ignore. configuration Version will be implement.
- Printing in a New windows rather then in the same frames.
Language is need to be translated to the pre define 3-9.
- Menu is still read from SQL and there is still not way to translate it yet.
- Horizontal Pull down menu is actually complete and we just need a time to activate it, mass change in header.php would be required.
There are too many table on SQL which increase the time/overhead on execute, simplification is needed. (Take example form SQL-Ledger)
