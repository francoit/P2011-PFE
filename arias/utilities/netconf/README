There are 2 files in this folder.
arias.conf is the apache https configuration files.
As I know so far, one ip only can have one ssl configuration
(Correct me if I'm wrong)

If you have a running ssl web server and would like to run arias on the 
other name you would need to make an alias to the network address.
which the ifcfg-eth0.1 is use for.

Please rename ifcfg-eth0.1 to ifcfg-eth0:1 (Or what ever you like).
